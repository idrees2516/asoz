- Dynamic auditor selection and removal
- Reputation management system

### 4. Key Management System
- Secure key generation and storage
- Distributed key revocation mechanism
- Certificate management
- Threshold signature scheme
- Authority management

## Usage

```cairo
// Initialize the Bulletproof system
let bulletproof_system = BulletproofSystem::new();

// Generate a range proof
let proof = bulletproof_system.prove(value, blinding);

// Verify the proof
let valid = bulletproof_system.verify(proof);

// Initialize the zk-SNARK system
let (proving_key, verification_key) = SnarkSystem::setup(circuit);

// Generate a zk-SNARK proof
let proof = SnarkSystem::prove(circuit, proving_key);

// Verify the zk-SNARK proof
let valid = SnarkSystem::verify(proof, verification_key, public_inputs);

// Register as an auditor
let result = auditor_framework.register_auditor(public_key);

// Verify a transaction
let valid = auditor_framework.verify_transaction(transaction);

// Generate a new key pair
let key_pair = key_management.generate_key(KeyPurpose::Transaction);

// Revoke a key
let certificate = key_management.revoke_key(key_hash, signatures);
```
