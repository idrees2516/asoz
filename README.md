## Architecture

The system implements a privacy-preserving payment system with auditing capabilities on public blockchain. Key features:

1. **Privacy**: Uses ring signatures and stealth addresses
2. **Auditability**: Supports selective disclosure through zero-knowledge proofs
3. **Scalability**: Implements efficient batch processing
4. **Security**: Multiple layers of cryptographic security
